## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing 🧹
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and format inconsistencies.
- Feature engineering to create new variables, such as total medals won by a country in each Olympic year.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
- Visualizing distributions of medals by country and year.
- Analyzing trends in athlete participation and medal counts over time.

### 3. Data Visualization 🎨
- Creating impactful visualizations to represent data insights:
  - Medal distribution by country.
  - Trends in Olympic participation over the years.
  - Sports that have gained or lost popularity.
